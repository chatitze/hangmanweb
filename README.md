# hangmanweb

The challenge is to build a simple version of a ‘hangman’ game as a web-app (look & feel is not important).
- The app should use jQuery and Ajax queries for interaction.
- The app should keep the current game state persistent across server and browser re-starts.
- The app should be built with ‘ant’ and produce a war file that can be deployed in a Tomcat instance.
- The app should have a ‘management’ page that shows a summary of the state of all games that are currently being played.
